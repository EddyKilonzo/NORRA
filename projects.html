                    Women and girls are rights-holders and as such are entitled to the full exercise and equal enjoyment of the right to education. However, in addition to being a fundamental right in and of itself, the right to education is a ‘multiplier right’ and is, therefore, instrumental in enabling them to benefit from and claim other key rights, such as those related to work, property, political participation, access to justice, freedom from violence and health, including sexual and reproductive health and rights.
                    <br> <br>
                    Girls who receive more education are less likely to marry as children and to become pregnant and young mothers. According to Plan, a girl in a low income country receiving seven years of education marries four years later on average, and has fewer and healthier children. According to UNESCO, children of literate mothers are over 50% more likely to live past the age of five. There are also significant health benefits for girls and women, with considerable evidence that an increase in a mother’s education reduces the likelihood of dying in childbirth.
                    <br><br>
                    With the proliferation of digital opportunities means more girls need quality technology education for all girls to increase their participation in digital opportuities. According to the World Bank Group (WBG), one year of secondary education for a girl can mean as much as a 25% increase in wages later in life. The benefits of this are passed on to their children as women tend to reinvest 90% of their income in their families and with new opportuities arising out of the new technology options, more girls will have better shots in increasing their employability
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Girls and women can face discrimination in all areas and throughout all stages of their life. Eliminating discrimination in education is an important start, but women and girls will often continue to face discrimination in income generating opportunities and business options. <br> Discrimination, in all its forms, whether it happens in public or private, needs to be tackled in a comprehensive and holistic manner (cross-sectorally and through various measures that take into account how discrimination and inequality aggregate throughout a woman’s life) and at all levels in order to ensure that women and girls enjoy and benefit from their education and in the meantime reduce poverty levels.

                     <em> <strong>RespectMYVoice</strong> </em> was created to address the cultural norms that prevent women from accessing technology in Samburu county. RespectMY Voice launched a radio production in August 2021 consisting of 12 episodes that teach listeners about the benefits of technology and justify women’s use of technology via religion and social concepts. The program met with families to discuss the show’s impact and the next steps toward destigmatizing the idea of women in tech.

                  Poverty is the biggest factor determining whether a girl accesses education. According to the Global Education Monitoring report, in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa, children from rich families, whether boy or girl, will most likely attend all levels of basic education. However, girls from poor families in sub-Saharan Africa, are less likely than their male peers to attend school and this lack of participation increases at higher education levels.
                    <br>
                  A number of factors contribute to girls from poor families not being able to attend school, the biggest of which is the lack of free education, particularly in the formative years. This may be because governments do not have legal and policy frameworks in place to make free education a reality or they do but it is not effectively implemented, or it may not be adequately resourced, or there may be corruption which draws resources away from their intended use.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    Lack of free education results in an added financial burden on families, which may come in the form of school fees (or other direct fees) or indirect fees such as for school uniforms, exam fees, security, school transportation, etc. Such fees are a direct barrier to school attendance for many girls, either because families cannot afford these costs or the costs may force families to select which of their children to send to school. In such instances, it is usually boys who are favoured because of the low social and economic value placed on the education of girls. 
                    <br> To mitigate this, international human rights law requires states to guarantee free and compulsory primary education, progressively free education at all other levels, and targeted measures for groups at risk of dropping out (for instance, school transportation for students living in rural areas). Human rights law, however, neglects the importance of free or accessible early childhood care and education (ECCE)/pre-primary education. ECCE has positive impacts on child development and targeted ECCE interventions ‘can compensate for vulnerability and disadvantage, regardless of underlying factors such as poverty and gender

                    Launched in 2020, the <em><strong>Entrepreneur Hub application’s</strong></em> trial run proved useful in the lives of 65 women, most of whom live under the poverty line. The women were provided with a smartphone as well as training on the app’s features. The app allows users to search for entrepreuneurship information, advertise their small businesses and connect with larger markets using voice navigation in their native language. <br> Users had access to important information that could help them strengthen their small busiesses. An important feature includes users to voice-record their business-related questions and receive a recording back from a knowledgable mentor.

                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    Child marriage is any formal marriage or informal union where one or both of the parties are under 18 years of age. According to Girls Not Brides, every year 15 million underage girls get married. Globally, it is estimated that there are 720 million women alive today who were married before the age of 18—that’s 10% of the world’s population. Child marriage happens everywhere but is most prevalent in south Asia (45% of girls married by 18; 17% married by 15), sub-Saharan Africa (39%; 12%), and Latin America and the Caribbean (23%; 5%). <br><br>
                    Child marriage is a discriminatory practice rooted in the notion that girls and women are inferior to men and should conform to gender stereotypes that value women as mothers, carers, the property of men, sexual objects, vulnerable and in need of protection, and not as rights-holders. Myriad factors also contribute to the perpetuation of child marriage, including: gender inequality, poverty, gaps in and non-implementation of laws, lack of education, peer pressure, and conflict and emergencies. See CARE’s page on the causes of child marriage for further information. <br><br>
                    FGM violates multiple human rights, including the right to education, making it a particularly egregious practice. Children who undergo FGM also get married and are more likely to drop out of school and children who are not in school are more likely to get married. Statistics from the World Bank and International Center for Research on Women reveal that 10-30% of parents, depending on country, reported that their child dropped out of secondary school due to child marriage and/or pregnancy. Their research also indicates that for every year a girl marries before the age of 18, the likelihood she completes secondary education decreases by 0.22 years on average. In Africa, girls who marry before the age of 12 have a reduced likelihood of 21% of completing their secondary education.

                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women defines gender-based violence against women (GBV) as ‘violence that is directed against a woman because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately’. Such violence takes multiple forms, including: ‘acts or omissions intended or likely to cause or result in death or physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, threats of such acts, harassment, coercion and arbitrary deprivation of liberty’.
                    <br><br>
                    The Committee considers GBV to be a form of discrimination, under Article 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979, CEDAW). The Committee’s legal interpretation of GBV as a human rights violation can be found primarily in General Recommendations 19 and 35.
                    <br><br>
                    Gender-based violence against girls, for instance, rape, domestic violence, sexual harassment and assault, corporal punishment, and harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation can keep girls out of school temporarily or indefinitely. Evidence collected by the World Bank Group shows that in Nicaragua, ‘63% of the children of abused women had to repeat a school year and dropped out of school on average four years earlier than others.’ And in Zambia, ‘girls who experienced sexual violence were found to have more difficulty concentrating on their studies, some students transferred to another school to escape harassment, and others dropped out of school because of pregnancy.’
                    <br><br>
                    GBV often occurs in schools, known as ‘school-related gender-based violence’ (SRGBV), which Unesco defines as: ‘acts or threats of sexual, physical or psychological violence occurring in and around schools, perpetrated as a result of gender norms and stereotypes, and enforced by unequal power dynamics’. SRGBV can often lead to girls under-performing and/or dropping out of school altogether.
